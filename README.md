INDEX is a cross-platform, high-dimensional tag-based indexing service designed to help users easily manage and retrieve various resources. By customizing tags, users can label resources such as files (e.g., images, videos, games, documents), webpages (e.g., URLs, HTML), and concepts (e.g., actors, virtual characters, virtual entities), and then quickly find the desired content through INDEX's powerful indexing system.

Developed using the Go language, INDEX offers stable performance and efficient resource utilization. The system includes both server and client components, allowing users to deploy the server on their own infrastructure and access it via the client. In addition, INDEX provides an integrated client, making it easy for users to use the service on laptops and other devices.

Communication between the INDEX server and client is based on gRPC, meaning that clients compatible with the gRPC protocol can easily connect to the INDEX service. Moreover, INDEX's open architecture offers ample opportunities for third-party developers to flexibly extend and customize its features, meeting the needs of various use cases.
